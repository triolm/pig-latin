    The forest raven (Corvus tasmanicus), also commonly known as the Tasmanian raven, is a passerine bird in the family
    Corvidae native to Tasmania and parts of southern Victoria, such as Wilsons Promontory and Portland. Populations are
    also found in parts of New South Wales, including Dorrigo and Armidale. Measuring 50–53 cm (20–21 in) in length, it
    has
    all-black plumage, beak and legs. As with the other two species of raven in Australia, its black feathers have grey
    bases. Adults have white irises; younger birds have dark brown and then hazel irises with an inner blue rim. New
    South
    Wales populations are recognised as a separate subspecies C. tasmanicus boreus, but appear to be nested within the
    Tasmanian subspecies genetically.
